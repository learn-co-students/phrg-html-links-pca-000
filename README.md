# HTML Links

### Cloning Down Your Repository

If you already have a personal repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username_here>/exceptional-realty
cd exceptional-realty
git fetch --all
git checkout main-pages
```

If you want to use the demo repository to follow along:

```
git clone https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/exceptional-realty-demo
cd exceptional-realty-demo
git fetch --all
git checkout html-tables
```

**Remember to use `httpserver` to live test your webpage**

### `<a href=''>`

The last thing we want to do for our basic site is to link all of our pages
together. We create links using the _anchor link_ element, written as `<a>`.
The `<a>` tag requires an `href` attribute to tell the browser where we want
the link to go to. We want to provide some navigation between pages, so just
below our `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags, let's add an opening and closing `<a>` tag
with the `href` attribute set to `index.html`. We then want to include the
visible text that will become the clickable on our page, so let's add in
'About' in between the opening and closing `<a>` tags. Go ahead and add
additional `<a>` tags pointed to our 'New Properties,' 'Listings,' 'Market
Report,' and 'Contact' HTML pages.

All of these links are internal, pointed to other parts of our site. If we
wanted to add an external link to another website, we would provide a full URL
path. Since we're building a real estate website, we probably want to provide a link
to useful homebuyers' resources. So, for a final `<a>` tag, let's add a link to
the Housing and Urban Development government website, at `http://hud.gov`, and
include 'H.U.D.' as the link text.

Now, for this last link, we want to add one additional attribute, `target`.
Setting this attribute to be `target='_blank'` will cause the browser to open a
new tab when the link is clicked, whereas the previous links will change the
location of the current tab. We've now got 6 links:

```
<a href="index.html">About</a>
<a href="new-properties.html">New Properties</a>
<a href="real-estate-listings.html">Listings</a>
<a href="market-report.html">Market Report</a>
<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
<a href="http://hud.gov" target='_blank'>H.U.D.</a>
```

These links will act as our navigation, so go ahead and copy these, and paste
them into each of your other HTML pages, just below your main headings. Some of
our pages don't have any content yet, so you may need to add some HTML and
content to `contact.html` and `new-properties.html`.

Once we've got links on every page, test out the page in a browser tab. We
should see now that we've got links going to each page of our site, and since
they're on every HTML file we've created, we can navigate back and forth
between our pages. If we click on the 'H.U.D.' link, we'll see that it opens a
new tab instead.

Congratulations, you've just built a website! In later lessons, we will
return to Exceptional Realty to introduce additional HTML5 concepts. If you're
working from your own repository, make sure to push to your remote repo so you
can have your code accessible later.

```
git add .
git commit -m 'started real-estate-listings.html'
git push
